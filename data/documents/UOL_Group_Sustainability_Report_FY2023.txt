ABOUT THIS REPORT
UOL’s annual sustainability report covers performance data and related information on our material environmental,
social and governance (ESG) topics for the period 1 January to 31 December 2023 (FY2023).
Unless otherwise stated, the report covers the property development, property investments and hotel operations
in Singapore, excluding those of listed SingLand but including the common associated and joint venture companies
of UOL Group and SingLand. SingLand publishes its own sustainability report, which is available on its corporate
website. Assets and revenue from operations covered in the report comprise approximately 47% of the Group’s
total assets and 67% of the Group’s total revenue respectively as at 31 December 2023. Performance data in the
Economic Performance section on pages 39 to 40 covers UOL Group’s global portfolio including all subsidiaries,
associated and joint venture companies. To align with the future International Sustainability Standards Board
(ISSB) reporting requirements, we will expand the scope of our sustainability report to include our overseas
operations by FY2025.
This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards and includes consideration of the GRI G4
Construction and Real Estate Sector Disclosures. The GRI Standards was adopted as it is internationally recognised
and provides a common framework for organisations to communicate their ESG performance in a comparable
and transparent manner, catering to the needs of a wide range of stakeholders. The report also complies with
the requirements of the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited (SGX-ST) Listing Rules Practice Note
7.6 Sustainability Reporting Guide, and incorporates climate-related disclosures taking guidance from the
recommendations set out by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). Definitions and
sources of data measurements are indicated in Appendix B.
For FY2023, Deloitte & Touche LLP was engaged to provide limited assurance on selected FY2023 GRI Standards
disclosures in accordance with the Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements (SSAE) 3000 (Revised).
The assurance statement can be found on pages 63 to 66 of this report.
We strive to continuously improve our reporting and welcome any feedback. Please send all feedback, questions
and comments to sustainability@uol.com.sg.

No hard copies of this report have been printed as part of our
efforts to promote resource conservation and reduce wastage.

GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENT
Dear Stakeholders,
At the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), four paradigm shifts were announced: fast-tracking the energy transition; transforming climate
finance; putting nature, people, lives and livelihoods at the heart of climate action; and ensuring inclusivity.
These shifts are aligned with Singapore’s climate ambition and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
At UOL, we have taken steps towards making our business and operations more resilient and sustainable, guided
by our Sustainability Vision of “Less Carbon, More Life” and Sustainability Framework. From improved energy
efficiency to the implementation of a Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) management system and support
for inclusive arts, UOL remains committed to our sustainability journey.

CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE ACTION
Climate risks can have a profound impact on organisations and the built environment. This sentiment is shared
in the World Economic Forum Global Risks Report 2024, which ranked extreme weather events as the top
long-term material crisis on a global scale. The Group is committed to reducing 46% of absolute Scope 1 and
2 GHG emissions by 2030 for our commercial and hospitality properties, against our 2019 baseline. To achieve
this target, during the year, we implemented various initiatives across our portfolio, including replacing and
upgrading equipment with energy-efficient models; retrofitting buildings for improved efficiency; and installing
solar panels where feasible. We are also monitoring advancements in renewable energy solutions and evaluating
opportunities for future integration.
We remain committed to greening our buildings and supporting the Singapore Green Plan. All our commercial
properties in Singapore are certified Green Mark by BCA and we aim to progressively obtain this certification for
all our existing hospitality properties in Singapore. As at December 2023, five out of 12 of our Singapore properties
are equipped with solar panels. Beyond solar power, all our commercial properties and hotels in Singapore have
installed food waste digesters while all our commercial and hospitality properties in Singapore are equipped
with electric vehicle charging facilities.

EMPOWERING OUR PEOPLE AND BUILDING STRONGER COMMUNITIES
The safety and well-being of our people is paramount. At the core of everything we do lies a fundamental belief
that our people deserve to return home safely every day. This commitment drives our relentless pursuit of a safe
and healthy work environment. We are currently pursuing ISO 45001 certification for all our Singapore properties,
with the goal of achieving it by 2024.
Recognising the significant labour challenges in the Singapore hospitality industry, we continually provide training
and development programmes for our employees. We are collaborating with the Singapore Tourism Board (STB)
on the Lighthouse Transformation Pilot Project, which aims to achieve three key outcomes: enhance productivity
to address labour cost concerns; elevate guest service; and create more attractive job roles for the local workforce.
As part of our effort to uplift the communities, in January 2023, we launched the three-year UOL-PPHG Community
Uplift Programme in collaboration with the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s Community Link
(ComLink). The Programme aims to provide a diverse range of enrichment activities to children from ComLink
families living in public rental flats, through partnership with mall tenants and support from employee volunteers.
In May 2023, in conjunction with our 60th anniversary, we launched our flagship UOL X ART:DIS Art Prize, which
aims to promote inclusive arts by providing a platform for artists with disabilities to showcase their talents. As an
advocate of inclusive hiring, we currently have 27 Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) employed across our properties.
In 2023, 12 PWDs were recognised with long service awards, reflecting tenures ranging from five to 34 years.

04

UOL GROUP LIMITED

We are pleased to receive several accolades at the prestigious Community Chest Awards 2023, as well as the
Distinguished Patron of the Arts award, for our ardent contributions to community building and the local art scene.

UPHOLDING HIGH STANDARDS OF SUSTAINABILITY
We are encouraged that our commitment to sustainability was recognised with an upgraded MSCI ESG rating to
“AA” in 2023, placing us among the leaders in the real estate development and diversified activities industry. We
are also honoured to receive Best Risk Management and Best Investor Relations bronze awards at the Singapore
Corporate Awards 2023 for our exemplary corporate governance practices and engagement with the investor
community. In February 2024, our hospitality business achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first
Singapore hospitality group to attain the GSTC certification for all our hotels and serviced suites in Singapore.
At the time of certification, we held the largest number of GSTC-certified rooms and properties in Singapore.
The sustainability reporting landscape continues to evolve. We aligned our climate-related disclosures with the
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations in FY2022, and we have started
to align our internal processes to meet the upcoming mandatory requirements to adopt the International
Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) standards for sustainability reporting by FY2025.

CHAMPIONING SUSTAINABILITY TOGETHER
Collective efforts and partnerships are crucial to addressing the complex environmental, social and economic
challenges facing us today. We thank all our stakeholders for their continual support on our sustainability journey.
We look forward to creating more value for our stakeholders and shaping a sustainable future for our current
and future generations, together.

MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT
A comprehensive materiality assessment was conducted in 2022 by an independent consultancy for the Group
to review the material ESG topics against industry trends, stakeholder feedback and our business objectives.
These material ESG topics were assessed and prioritised based on their potential impacts on the environment,
society and responsible business practices. In 2023, a materiality review was conducted again, where the existing
material ESG topics were evaluated to be highly relevant and hence remained unchanged.

2019-2022 energy consumption and GHG emissions for hospitality properties have been restated to reflect a more accurate calculation methodology
for district cooling.
UOL started developing our Scope 3 GHG inventory in 2022. Hence, data prior to 2022 is unavailable. Additionally, the scope of assurance excludes
Scope 3 emissions.
The increase in Scope 3 business travel data in 2023 was attributable to an increase in overseas travel activities from driving business growth.

ENVIRONMENTAL

DEVELOPING BETTER: MANAGING CLIMATE RISK AND BUILDING RESILIENCY
MITIGATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
UOL’s strategy to become climate-resilient involves integrating environmental considerations throughout our
businesses, from early stages in design, to later stages in construction and our operations. Guided by our Group
Environmental Policy, we strive for efficient use of resources, and have in place environmental management
systems to measure, monitor, and review our environmental performance regularly.
Group Environmental Policy
We are committed to:

protecting the
environment and
reducing pollution
through conservation
of energy and water
consumption

carrying out
activities in an
environmentallyfriendly manner and
continually improving
our environmental
performance

complying to
all relevant
environmental and
other requirements
stipulated by the
authorities

building sustainable
and resourceefficient operations
to mitigate the
effects of climate
change

Our property and hospitality businesses are ISO 14001-certified. As a developer, we require our main contractors
assigned for development projects to be both ISO 14001-certified and certified by BCA under the Green and
Gracious Builder Scheme.
During the year, the Group attained at least Green Mark Gold by BCA for all commercial properties in Singapore.
We will raise our targets to achieve Green Mark GoldPlus certification for all future redevelopments and new
commercial properties in Singapore. Four out of eight hospitality properties in Singapore have achieved Green
Mark certifications. We are working towards obtaining Green Mark certifications for all our remaining Singapore
hospitality properties.
In February 2024, our hospitality business achieved a significant milestone by becoming the first Singapore
hospitality group to attain the GSTC Multi Site certification across all hotels and serviced suites in Singapore.
At the time of certification, we held the largest number of GSTC-certified rooms and properties in Singapore.
GSTC is a certification body that manages and sets global standards for sustainable travel and tourism practices.
UOL is committed to creating environmental awareness within our organisation and motivating our stakeholders
to join our pursuit of a sustainable future. We actively communicate eco-friendly tips and best practices to our
employees through our Intranet. Signages and stickers are also placed prominently in our offices to remind
everyone to save energy, water and paper.
At our hospitality properties, we engage our guests and encourage them to participate in our sustainability
efforts such as reusing towels and linens. We also offer guided tours to share our sustainability initiatives. This
collaborative method promotes a collective responsibility towards environmental stewardship.
UOL recognises the importance of minimising biodiversity loss, especially during the development of property
and landscaping of our commercial and hospitality properties. In Singapore, the significance of biodiversity
loss is largely minimised due to the urban environment our properties are located in. Our developments strictly
adhere to the National Parks Board requirements.

UOL GROUP LIMITED

Pinetree Hill (artist’s impression) is an elevated sanctuary with lush greenery within and beyond the development.

Eco-conscious urban living at Pinetree Hill
Pinetree Hill is a 520-unit development with its design focused on sustainability and eco-friendly living.
It received the BCA Green Mark Platinum Super Low Energy Award with Maintainability Badge, which
demonstrates our commitment to environmental excellence through sustainable products and design.
Located at Pine Grove, Pinetree Hill is spread across three 24-storey towers with breathtaking views of
Clementi Forest and Bukit Timah Nature Reserve. Besides capitalising on the vast greenery surrounding
the development, the integration of lush landscaping within it helps to combat the Urban Heat Island
effect (or trapped urban heat) by reducing solar heat gain. The development also reduces dependence
on air conditioning by promoting natural ventilation.
To cut down on energy use, there will be demand control systems such as timers and motion sensors
for lighting and ventilation in common areas, and further complemented by energy efficiency products
such as LED lightings, air-conditioning systems and kitchen appliances. Additionally, the installation
of solar photovoltaic systems on the rooftops aims to offset 30% of the electricity needs for selected
common facilities, while the lifts are equipped with Variable Voltage Variable Frequency, regenerative
drives and ‘sleep mode’ to conserve energy.
Passive design elements are central to Pinetree Hill, which uses materials and finishes with low Volatile
Organic Compound emissions. The adoption of the Prefabricated Prefinished Volumetric Construction
(PPVC) technology for its construction will also minimise waste and enhance workers’ safety and
productivity.
Residents of Pinetree Hill can enjoy nature and a healthy lifestyle when the design of communal spaces,
including playgrounds, gardens and exercise areas, encourages them to engage with the outdoors.
Beyond the site, the upcoming Clementi Nature Trail within the Clementi Forest, which will connect the
existing Rail Corridor to the upcoming nature park in Dover Forest, will be a good draw for nature lovers.
Pinetree Hill represents a forward-thinking approach to residential development, where the well-being
of residents and the planet are prioritised through design and technology.

ADVANCING OUR CLIMATE DISCLOSURES
Extreme weather event was ranked as the top long-term material crisis on a global scale by the World Economic
Forum Global Risks Report 2024. UOL is cognisant of this and is focused on supporting the transition towards
a low-carbon economy in our businesses. At the Group level, we have identified climate-related risks and
opportunities affecting our business operations and have prepared our TCFD report focusing on four key areas of
governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The table below maps UOL’s current disclosure
to the four pillars of TCFD recommendations and highlights our current progress and next steps for the Group.

Disclosure

Next Steps

GOVERNANCE
Describe the board’s
oversight of climaterelated risks and
opportunities

Describe
management’s role
in assessing and
managing climaterelated risks and
opportunities

The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for overseeing and
monitoring ESG issues, including climate risks and opportunities,
for the Group and considers them in UOL’s strategic business
plans.

Further strengthen
climate risk
considerations in UOL’s
strategy development.

The ARMSC, as delegated by the Board of Directors, reviews and
advises the Board on the Group’s overall sustainability strategy,
targets, polices, roadmap, reports and disclosures. The ARMSC
meets half-yearly to discuss updates such as climate risks and
opportunities, and updates the Board as necessary. All targets are
approved by the Board and assisted by the ARMSC.

Continue to engage the
Board and ARMSC in
TCFD and ESG-related
trainings.

The ARMSC is supported by the SSC, which is chaired by the
Group Chief Executive and Chief Legal and Sustainability Officer/
Company Secretary. The SSC prepares the plans for and makes key
decisions on the implementation of UOL’s sustainability strategy.

Sustainability factors
have been considered in
non-financial Strategic
and Transformational
KPIs. This includes
addressing GHG
emissions in the medium
and long term. We will
continue to review
and monitor our nonfinancial KPIs.

UOL has assessed climate-related risks (chronic and acute physical
risks; transition risks) and opportunities across our portfolio in
terms of asset classes and their locations.

Further classify climaterelated risks and
opportunities according
to time horizons (short,
medium and long term)
across entire portfolio
and asset classes to
evaluate their risks and
exposures.

STRATEGY
Describe the climaterelated risks and
opportunities the
organisation has
identified over the
short, medium and
long term

We have focused on our assets (commercial and hospitality
properties, and development projects) in Singapore as
approximately 85% of our revenue is generated in Singapore.
Physical Risks:
– Chronic:
• Rising sea levels
• Rising mean temperatures
• Extreme variability in weather patterns
– Acute:
• Increased severity of extreme weather events such as flash
floods, wildfire, heat waves and tropical cyclones
Transition Risks:
– Policy and Legal Risks: More stringent building regulations (e.g.
building codes) for development projects and existing buildings
– Policy and Legal Risks: Enhanced emissions-reporting
obligations, and carbon pricing for the built environment
– Market Risk: Increased demand from stakeholders for more
resilient and sustainable buildings
– Technology Risk: Cost associated with the transition to a lowercarbon economy including available technologies and cost of
raw materials
– Reputation Risk: Changing customer preferences for more
sustainable options

Next Steps

Opportunities:
– Resource efficiency through improved operational efficiency,
resource optimisation, and deployment of renewable energy and
innovative technologies
– Sustainable financing (e.g. sustainability-linked loans) to
finance our sustainability initiatives and meet our targets, while
potentially reducing the cost of borrowing
Describe the impact of
climate-related risks
and opportunities
on the organisation’s
businesses, strategy
and financial planning

Impacts of Climate-related Risks:
Climate risk may have financial impacts on UOL’s business
through:
– Increased operating costs from higher energy demands, higher
energy prices, and increased re/insurance protection in areas of
higher risk to climate change effects
– Increased production costs due to operational and supply chain
disruptions
– Reduced revenue as a result of lower business activities from
operational disruptions
– Impairment charges to assets (e.g. from damage or risk of
stranding) and consequently, lower portfolio valuation
– Payments to carbon tax regimes in different jurisdictions

Further evaluate the
impacts of climaterelated risks and
opportunities on UOL’s
financial performance
and position.

Impacts of Climate-related Opportunities:
Climate-related opportunities could result in:
– Reduced operating costs and savings in the long term from
improved operational efficiencies, resource optimisation, and
effective deployment of renewable energy and innovative
technologies
– Improved reputation and brand recognition as a leading
property and hospitality group
– Increased access to sustainable financing instruments
– Increased value of fixed assets (e.g. highly rated energy-efficient
buildings in our portfolio)
– Reduce exposure to non-renewable energy source prices
(through adoption of renewable energy)
Describe the resilience
of the organisation’s
strategy, taking into
consideration different
climate-related
scenarios, including a
2°C or lower scenario

UOL is in the progress of performing climate-related scenario
analysis for our assets in Singapore, Australia and the United
Kingdom. We will conduct the analysis using two different
temperature scenarios (1.5°C and 4°C) across three time horizons:
2030, 2050 and 2100 - representing short, medium and long term.

Conduct a climate
scenario analysis that
assesses the physical
and transition risks
identified across two
different climate
scenarios to understand
the impact on our assets.
Disclose output of the
scenario analysis in our
FY2024 Sustainability
Report.

RISK MANAGEMENT
Describe the
organisation’s
processes for
identifying and
assessing climaterelated risks

UOL has an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework,
which aims to increase confidence in the Group’s strategies,
businesses, and operations through assurance that key risks are
properly and systematically addressed.
Please refer to pages 6, 35 to 36 of this report for detailed
information on:
– Governance structure for managing risk

ENERGY AND GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In line with global and national climate commitments, the Group aims to reduce 46% of Scope 1 and 2 GHG
emissions for our commercial and hospitality properties by 2030 against our 2019 baseline. The target will be
achieved through multifaceted approaches: energy efficiency measures; renewable energy through onsite solar
panels; procurement of renewable energy; other sustainability initiatives; and balancing the residual emissions
that cannot be removed with carbon credits and offsets. The achievement of the 2030 target is dependent on
various external factors, including the maturity and readiness of the renewable energy market.
In addition to our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emission reduction target, the Group is also committed to addressing our
Scope 3 GHG emissions. We have made progress by disclosing several material Scope 3 categories since our
FY2022 Sustainability Report. The Group is currently exploring opportunities to expand our Scope 3 inventory,
in line with the GHG Protocol.
The Group continues to assess and where feasible, implement solar panel installations across its properties. As at
December 2023, five properties in Singapore housed solar panels with the capacity to generate over one Megawattpeak (MWp) of combined solar energy – the equivalent of powering 250 four-room Housing Development Board
(HDB) flats in a year. As part of the ongoing redevelopment of Odeon 333, we will be installing solar panels. We
will continue to assess the feasibility of installing solar panels across more properties. In 2023, approximately
889 MWh or 1% of our total energy consumption came from onsite solar energy.
We partnered a third-party energy consultant to conduct a comprehensive energy audit across all our commercial
and hospitality properties in Singapore. The audit identified key areas of improvement, and we have taken actions
to address them while we continue to seek new opportunities and technologies to further enhance our energy
efficiency and overall performance. At PARKROYAL on Beach Road, we upgraded the chiller plant and optimised
the air handling units, resulting in approximately 17% reduction in energy consumption. We also replaced the lessefficient iridescent bulbs with LED lightings in some of our commercial and hospitality properties. Additionally,
we adjusted air conditioning temperature settings to optimise comfort while minimising energy use. All our
properties in Singapore are also equipped with electric vehicle charging facilities.
In 2023, our commercial and hospitality properties contributed to 92.1% of the total Scope 1 and 2 GHG
emissions. The energy consumption5 was 84,022 MWh and Scope 1 and 2 emissions was 33,269 tonnes of CO2e,
which represented a 3.6% and 2.4% decrease respectively as compared with 2022. This is mainly attributed to
the closure and redevelopment of Faber House and the divestment of PARKROYAL on Kitchener Road, offset by
the opening of Pan Pacific Orchard. Compared with our 2019 baseline, energy consumption decreased by 16%
and Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduced by 20%. This is mainly due to a combination of energy efficiency measures
implemented across our commercial and hospitality properties and lower occupancy rates in our hospitality
properties compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2019. For our development projects, the total energy consumed6
in 2023 was 10,298 MWh. As for GHG emissions, the total amounted to 2,863 tonnes of CO2e.
Our estimated Scope 3 GHG emissions7 in 2023 was 18,361 tonnes of CO2e. We are reviewing and assessing the
operational boundaries of our Scope 3 inventory and data quality, to align with the expectations of the ISSB and
GHG Protocol reporting requirements.

Energy consumption includes electricity consumption from the grid, cooling consumption, piped gas and diesel used onsite.
Energy consumed mainly comes from electricity and diesel use.
We currently disclose Scope 3 GHG emissions for four categories: fuel- and energy-related activities; waste generated from operations; business travel;
and downstream leased assets.

WATER
UOL utilises both potable water and NEWater, a form of reclaimed wastewater, drawn from municipal sources,
across our diverse building operations, maintenance activities and development projects. While Singapore has
low water risk rating according to the World Resources Institute's Aqueduct tool, we remain committed to responsible
water management across all our activities. Our hospitality properties have various water conservation efforts
in place to reduce water consumption. All hotels implemented a programme to encourage guests to reuse linen
and towels. At PARKROYAL on Beach Road, guests staying three nights or more can opt out of housekeeping
and receive dining vouchers as an incentive. In addition, rainwater harvesting systems are in use at Pan Pacific
Orchard, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay and PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023

In 2023, our commercial and hospitality properties consumed 809 megalitres of water, a 6.7% increase compared
with 758 megalitres in 2022 due to higher footfall in our malls and greater occupancy in our hotels. This also led
to an increase in the Group’s water intensity by GFA occupied to 2.2 m3/m2. Compared with our 2019 baseline,
water consumption decreased by 11%, mainly due to a combination of water conservation measures and lower
occupancy rates in our hospitality properties compared with pre-pandemic levels in 2019.
We will continue to track and monitor our progress against our water consumption targets at our commercial
and hospitality properties. This will help us to develop effective water conservation strategies and implement
water-saving features to reduce our water consumption. Our commitment to water conservation is reflected in
our ongoing efforts to review water management plans, implement water-saving features where feasible, and
leverage sub-metering systems to monitor our water consumption patterns. In our development projects, water
is reused for washing bays and dust control, effectively reducing water consumption. Our development projects
recorded 109 megalitres of water consumption in 2023.

WASTE
UOL is committed to minimising waste generation and promoting resource conservation. Our approach is aligned
with Singapore’s Zero Waste Masterplan, such as reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill, segregating food
waste for treatment, and implementing recycling practices across our commercial and hospitality properties.
Since 2019, our hotels have pledged to support WWF’s Plastic ACTion (PACT) initiative of reducing single-use
plastics. Since then, all hospitality properties have installed in-room filtered water taps to eliminate the need for
plastic bottles. Nespresso capsules are also upcycled by Nespresso into coffee compost and recycled aluminium.
Old furnishings that are functioning but unsuitable for guest use are redeployed to back-of-house, donated to
non-profit organisations or recycled, where feasible.
The retail and hospitality industry plays a crucial role in tackling food waste. In 2023, we completed the installation
of food waste digesters in all our commercial properties and hotels in Singapore. We also educated and encouraged
our tenants on the use of our food waste digesters. To further minimise food waste, all our hotels implemented
measures to anticipate consumer demand. For example, all hotel kitchens utilise guest reservation data to
adjust the quantity of food prepared. For buffets, a controlled portion of food is initially served, with further
replenishment based on demand. Additionally, some of our hotels repurpose excess food ingredients into new
dishes. Watermelon rinds are incorporated into dim sum and excess bread is repurposed as bread pudding.

UOL GROUP LIMITED

During the year, we introduced e-waste recycling bins in all of our commercial properties to reduce the amount
of e-waste sent to the landfill. We aim to install e-waste recycling bins in all our commercial and hospitality
properties by 2024. We are currently piloting a batteries and lamp recycling programme in Odeon (comprises
Odeon 331 and Odeon 333), which includes breakage and leakage response procedures.
All our development sites have implemented recycling initiatives, including the provision of bins for paper, plastic
and cans. Additionally, we collect metal scraps and rebar for recycling purposes. We adopt green design practices
and use eco-friendly construction materials such as C7 drains for surface drainage and wheel stoppers for car
parks, which incorporate the use of recycled materials in their manufacturing processes. To minimise the need for
rework and reduce waste production, we employ Building Information Modelling (BIM) to enhance coordination
and streamline construction processes, and utilise PPVC technology and prefabricated bathroom units (PBU).
In 2023, our commercial and hospitality properties generated a total of 7,021 tonnes of non-hazardous waste
with 6,546 tonnes of waste sent for disposal and 475 tonnes of waste sent for recycling8. Compared with 2022,
our total waste disposal remained relatively stable, increasing only by 1% even though the footfall in our malls
and occupancy in our hotels had increased.
The waste collected for disposal, treatment and recycling are managed by waste management and recycling
companies licensed by the National Environment Agency. To monitor our waste footprint, we collect and monitor
waste-related data using both weight- and invoice-based approaches. Waste data is gathered from waste disposal
records and recycling reports.

SOCIAL

BUILDING GOOD: EMPOWERING PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES
HEALTH AND SAFETY
We are committed to creating a safe and healthy work environment for everyone involved in our business,
including employees, contractors and customers. We strive for zero incidents across our operations.
Workplace Safety and Health Management System
Following a third-party gap analysis in 2022, the Group implemented a Workplace Safety and Health (WSH)
management system aligned with ISO 45001 for Occupational Health and Safety Management Systems and the
Approved Code of Practice (ACOP) for Chief Executives and Board of Directors. We aim to achieve ISO 45001
certification for all Singapore properties by 2024.
Our WSH management system incorporates the WSH Hazards Identification and Risk Assessment Procedure.
This guides regular risk assessments to identify hazards and implement appropriate control measures at every
level. We continually evaluate and adapt these measures based on data, inspections and employee consultation.
Risk assessments are led by trained personnel, employing a systematic approach that involves examining incident
records, inspecting work areas and machinery, and consulting with employees. For non-routine situations such
as the introduction of new equipment, modifications to the work environment, or significant process changes, a
comprehensive risk review is undertaken. This review evaluates potential hazards and identifies necessary mitigation
measures. The results of these processes play a vital role in continuously improving our WSH management
system and performance metrics.
The Group fosters a collaborative safety culture. Guided by our Occupational Safety and Health Consultation and
Participation Management Procedure, we have established channels for employee participation, including WSH
committees with employee representatives; open communication and reporting channels for safety concerns;
and regular employee feedback surveys on safety and well-being.
The WSH committees meet regularly to discuss on matters including the review of WSH objectives and targets,
evaluation of current work procedures and exploration of new safety improvements.
We encourage our stakeholders to engage the Group on safety. As such, we have established an anonymous
online WSH feedback channel to allow employees and contractors to share feedback with the Group’s Safety
Officer, without fear of reprisal.
The Group prioritises preventing work-related hazards and ill-health through a hierarchy of controls framework,
aligned with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM)’s WSH risk management code of practice. A robust incident
management process ensures thorough investigation and corrective actions following incidents. An incident
response team investigates reported incidents, develops corrective actions based on the hierarchy of controls,
and classifies incidents for the appropriate response level. Investigation findings are communicated to all relevant
stakeholders.
Incident Reporting
In 2023, we recorded zero fatalities and a total of 169 injuries across all our properties compared with 189 injuries
in 2022. This includes guests, tenants, visitors, employees and contractors in our commercial and hospitality
properties, and development projects.
Development Projects
UOL works closely with our main contractors to provide a safe environment for all workers at our development
projects. We require all main contractors to be ISO 45001-certified and all sites to have appointed safety supervisors
and personnel to conduct regular safety briefings, checks, and training on basic worksite safety and other workrelated hazards. All main contractors provide their workers with health insurance coverage.

26

UOL GROUP LIMITED

To encourage a safe work environment for everyone,
we conduct monthly joint safety inspections at each
development project. These inspections are conducted
by our Safety consultant and the Group’s Safety
Officer with project managers, consultants and main
contractors. We regularly monitor safety performance
at site meetings and through quarterly safety reports.
Additionally, main contractors are required to report
all reportable injuries at site meetings and submit
detailed case reports.

LOST DAY RATE

In 2023, our main contractors recorded a total of five
work-related injuries and 109 lost days, while our subcontractors recorded three work-related injuries and 82
lost days. Our recordable work-related injury rate was
1.26 per million man-hours worked, reflecting a 73%
decrease from 4.71 per million man-hours worked in
2022. Similarly, our lost day rate has improved by 63%,
from 80.9 in 2022 to 30.2 in 2023.

The Pan Pacific Cares programme reflects our commitment to deliver the highest standards of safety, well-being
and hospitality services to guests across our hospitality properties. It complements our existing strict cleaning
and hygiene protocols to ensure a safe and clean environment for our guests and employees. All our hospitality
employees are required to undergo health and safety training.
In 2023, there were 78 recordable work-related injuries for our employees and other workers, which included
contractors, suppliers and interns. This is a slight improvement from the 82 injuries recorded in 2022. The rate of
recordable work-related injuries was 28.96 per million man-hours worked in 2023, reflecting a 7% improvement

In the hospitality industry, food safety is crucial to the well-being of our hotel guests. We have in place the
Food Safety Management System (FSMS) to enhance our existing procedures to cultivate best practices in our
food safety culture. Our FSMS includes extensive food safety training and external audits along the entire food
chain, from the receipt of raw produce to food preparation and delivery. Action plans are developed based on
recommendations proposed during external audits.
In 2023, we recorded one food safety incident in one of our hotels that had no health impact on guests.
Nevertheless, we take such an incident very seriously. A thorough investigation was conducted with immediate
corrective actions carried out.

TALENT ATTRACTION AND RETENTION
The Group’s workforce in Singapore is approximately 1,900 people, with 93% working in our hospitality business.
We firmly believe our people are our greatest asset, and we are committed to fostering a supportive and
empowering work environment.
This commitment is reflected in our focus on attracting and retaining talent. We offer a competitive remuneration
package, promote work-life balance, and provide opportunities for continuous learning and development. We
invest in our employees' growth and development, ensuring they have the skills and knowledge to thrive in this
fast-paced and challenging business environment.
Training and development
Investing in our talent pipeline is crucial for long-term success. Our property business conducted a talent review to
identify and develop potential future leaders. During the year, a leadership workshop was conducted for selected
employees to nurture essential skills such as strategic thinking, effective communication, decision-making and
leadership competencies, to prepare them as potential future leaders. Beyond leadership development, we
continued to offer programmes, covering functional and soft skills, career planning and performance management.
Additionally, we hosted talks on market trends in the real estate sector, aimed at keeping employees informed and
engaged. In 2023, we implemented a comprehensive WSH training programme, which comprised introduction
to the WSH framework, followed by targeted courses tailored to specific roles. Workshops on developing risk
management plans further empowered employees to proactively identify and mitigate potential hazards.
In 2023, PPHG launched the EdApp, which is a digital learning library with over 50 online courses. The platform
allows employees in our hospitality business to access on-demand learning opportunities, enabling them to
hone their managerial skills and broaden their knowledge of key systems. Two new training programmes were
introduced in 2023 at PPHG - Performance Management and Review training and PPHG Management Development
Programme. The former ensures our new people managers are equipped with the skillset and understanding
of PPHG’s performance management framework, and the latter focuses on developing employees in the areas
of leadership, communication skills, coaching and change management. During the year, PPHG continued to
partner the Ministry of Education (MOE) to host MOE Officers and Teachers for Work Attachment programme
at its properties. Through firsthand interactions with PPHG leadership team, MOE educators can inspire and
empower their students to pursue careers in the hospitality industry. In 2023, PPHG was recognised as a Partner
of AST (Academy of Singapore Teachers) Award Recipient at the Academy Awards for Professional Development.
Our focus on learning and development in 2023 resulted in an average of 48 training hours per employee across
our property and hospitality businesses, exceeding the previous year's average of 33 hours. Our property business
achieved an average of 35 training hours per employee, surpassing the target of 25 hours. Our hospitality business
also met its target, with an average of 48 training hours per employee.

Building hotels of the future
Guided by findings from the Singapore Hotel Industry’s Jobs Transformation Map (JTM) study on
the impact of key trends affecting Singapore’s hospitality industry, PPHG has been selected by the
Singapore Tourism Board (STB) and Workforce Singapore to pioneer the Lighthouse Transformation
Pilot Project, which is a three-year project starting from 2023 to address manpower challenges and
reimagine future hotel operations.
The Lighthouse Transformation Pilot Project plays the pathfinding role in the hospitality industry to
redesign nine job roles across six functions: Front Office, Bell & Concierge, Housekeeping, Central
Reservations, Food and Beverage, and Security. Along with PPHG’s programmes for talent attraction
and retention, learning and development, as well as succession frameworks, we aim to enhance career
opportunities for our employees by encouraging them to upskill and reskill themselves, and pursue
different roles throughout their career.
Representing the different brands under PPHG, these three hotels were identified to participate in the
project: Pan Pacific Singapore, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Marina Bay and PARKROYAL on Beach Road.
Work trials are carried out for one job role at each of the three hotels. The goal is to identify opportunities
for change, upgrade necessary skills and evaluate potential technologies aimed at simplifying jobs.
Findings from the Lighthouse Transformation Pilot Project will eventually lead to a playbook that will
benefit Singapore’s hospitality industry.
The playbook will serve as a guide to:
• Uplift productivity to tackle higher labour costs
• Provide bespoke, anticipatory services to address changing guest expectations
• Map out job roles that Singaporeans are willing to take on, thus reducing reliance on foreign workers

PPHG hosted Workforce Singapore and STB to share the learning journey of PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, one of our three hotels
involved in the pilot project.

Employee well-being
Recognising that employee well-being, both physical and mental, plays a pivotal role in building a strong peoplecentric culture, we provide employees with a range of safety and wellness-related programmes including a
confidential, professional counselling service fully paid by the Company. Workshops on mental health and
wellness are held regularly, with topics including stress and anxiety management, and workplace team dynamics.
All employees also have access to annual health screenings.
In 2023, UOL and PPHG conducted a staff engagement survey with Gallup. Feedback received through this
comprehensive survey helped us to understand the sentiments, expectations and concerns of our employees,
and to improve the work environment for them.
The Group organises townhall meetings for leadership to keep employees updated on significant company
updates and instil a sense of unity. Long service awards are also given out to recognise employees for their loyalty
and dedication to the Group. For PPHG, we hold employee engagement events such as the Global Leadership
Conference, which brings together leaders from our global properties to connect and share ideas.
Camaraderie is fostered through social activities such as team bonding retreats and the annual Dinner and Dance.
In November 2023, to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Group, a large-scale Dinner and Dance was held for
a record number of about 1,300 UOL and PPHG employees.

The Group maintains a good balance of gender ratios, with women making up 47% of our total workforce as at
end 2023. In addition, 49% of the Senior Management positions comprised women. Employees are recruited,
evaluated and compensated based on their merit, experience and knowledge. Open communication is encouraged
for employees to seek feedback and collaborate with supervisors to enhance their performance. We had 96%
of property business employees and 95% of hospitality business employees receiving feedback through annual
appraisals in 2023.
Age Diversity
As at 31 December 2023, over 36% of our property business and 19% of our hospitality business employees were
above the age of 50. The skills, knowledge and experience held by this group of employees play an important role
in the success of our organisation. To foster a cohesive work environment and bridge generational differences,
we offer workshops for employees to understand the unique perspectives, work styles and values of various
generations.
Persons with Disabilities
The Group currently employs 27 PWDs across our Singapore properties. In 2023, 12 PWDs from our hospitality
business were recognised with long service awards, ranging from five to 34 years of service. We have been
collaborating with SG Enable to provide internship and employment opportunities at our hotels for students
with disabilities.
In 2023, we organised two virtual Disability Awareness talks by SG Enable for employees at the UOL corporate
office, the Group’s frontline employees and UOL’s mall tenants. The sessions helped to equip them with the
knowledge on the different types of disabilities and how to interact with PWDs. UOL also organised a basic
Singapore Sign Language class for our employees, conducted by our deaf employee, so they could learn more
about the deaf community and embrace inclusivity at the workplace.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE QUALITY
UOL is committed to delivering high-quality products and services. We achieve this by prioritising our customers
through exceptional customer service, promoting innovation and developing sustainable buildings.

The MOU aims to collectively redefine industry
standards by taking a value chain approach to
transformation to the industry.

On 12 January 2023, UOL cemented a partnership with United Tec
Construction and P&T Consultants to focus on developing new
capabilities to enhance construction productivity. Mr Desmond
Lee, Minister for National Development, witnessed the signing
ceremony of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The
alliance includes developing a multi-year work plan on value
chain transformation, boosting construction productivity, and
integrating project planning and building design using digital
technologies. On 17 November 2023, Mr Liam Wee Sin, UOL Group
Chief Executive, received the MND Medallion Distinguished
Service award from the Ministry of National Development for his
contribution to the Buildability and Quality Advisory Committee,
which he co-chairs.

During the year, we achieved our target of attaining at least BCA Green Mark Gold or higher for all our commercial
properties in Singapore. We will raise our target to achieve Green Mark GoldPlus certification for all redevelopments
and new commercial properties in Singapore. Furthermore, the Group commits to progressively obtain Green
Mark certification for all our hospitality properties in Singapore. In February 2024, we were the first Singapore
hospitality group to attain the GSTC Multi Site certification across all our properties in Singapore. At the time
of certification, we held the largest number of GSTC-certified rooms and properties in Singapore.
We adhere to the BCA Accessibility Code and have retrofitted rooms with wheelchair-accessible features and
elderly-friendly fittings, such as no-barrier access and bathroom grab bars. Currently, we offer 20 wheelchairand elderly-friendly rooms across our Singapore hospitality properties.
In 2023, we maintained guest satisfaction scores of 80% and above across all our hotels in Singapore.

UOL GROUP LIMITED

LOCAL COMMUNITIES
We are committed to supporting underprivileged groups in the communities where we operate. Apart from
monetary donations, we leverage our people, assets and partnerships to roll out community initiatives, which
focus on causes related to children, youth, education, sports and the arts.
In support of education, UOL and our subsidiary SingLand jointly contributed $5 million to the Lee Kuan Yew
Centennial Fund, which contributes to the educational development of Singapore’s youth to become visionary
leaders to shape the nation’s future. UOL also continued to contribute to the bursaries of Care Corner Student
Care Centres, Institute of Technical Education and Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
In January 2023, UOL and PPHG collaborated with
the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s
Community Link (ComLink) to launch the UOL-PPHG
Community Uplift Programme, which aims to offer a
range of enrichment and learning opportunities for
children who live in public rental flats. Partners from
our malls were encouraged to support activities such as
rock climbing and art and craft, while staff volunteers
helped to organise them and engage the children.
The Group also donated $60,000 to support other
programmes by ComLink @ Jurong West.

Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Ministerin-charge of Social Services Integration, who is also the Adviser to
West Coast Grassroots Organisations, graced the launch of the
UOL-PPHG Community Uplift Programme.

During the year, PPHG continued its second run of
the Mentorship Programme with Boon Lay Secondary
School. Launched in 2022, the programme enables secondary school students to shadow our hotel employees
in various job functions such as engineering, front office and culinary. This provides students with exposure to
potential career paths in the hospitality industry. We continued to journey with the participants post-programme
by providing part-time work opportunities at our hotels.
In support of inclusive sports, UOL was the official prize sponsor of the annual National Deaf Games organised
by the Deaf Sports Association Singapore in November 2023.
UOL has been promoting inclusive arts since 2014. We provide spaces at our malls and hotels to showcase the
works of artists with disabilities. We also purchase paintings from ART:DIS for our residential showflats. During the
year, UOL sponsored a year-long art showcase at United Square to display about 40 artworks of four artists from
ART:DIS. UOL also sponsored art jamming workshops for two of the artists to let shoppers learn art techniques
from them, while we also helped to support the artists’ livelihoods with some fees and give them the opportunity
to develop their skills in conducting workshops.
PPHG is also active in the art community. During the year, it was the Official Hotel Partner for National Gallery
Singapore’s signature fundraising event – Gallery Benefit, where it sponsored hotel room stays for overseas artists
who contributed artworks to the Gallery’s fundraising auction. The Pan Pacific Hanoi Art Award was launched in
September 2023 to uplift special needs and emerging Vietnamese artists.
Staff volunteerism is encouraged by the Group for employees to bond and create a positive impact on the
society. UOL organised a karaoke session at KINEX for the elderly from AWWA Senior Community Home, who
were joined by UOL and SingLand volunteers in May 2023. Another outing was organised for the elderly to visit
a mushroom farm in November 2023. During the September school holidays, we hosted 50 children from Care
Corner Student Care Centres to enjoy a movie treat with a sumptuous lunch at Marina Square. During Christmas,
UOL volunteers packed and delivered presents to over 120 children from Care Corner and Comlink. The presents
were sponsored by shoppers and UOL to grant the children their wishes.

The Group has been supporting the annual SG Cares Giving Week by raising awareness of the national campaign
on our malls’ social media platforms. UOL also shared on Giving Week how we empowered shoppers to do good
through the mall-wide UOL Gives Back campaign held in November and December 2023. During the campaign,
shoppers participated in Community Chest’s initiative - Change for Charity - to convert their loyalty points into
cash donations to charities. Shoppers also took part in a charity sale with proceeds donated to The Salvation
Army, and utilised The Salvation Army recycling bins to donate pre-loved clothing. During Chinese New Year
and Christmas, shoppers made online donations to Community Chest.
In 2023, the Group was recognised for our community efforts. As an ardent supporter of the local art scene, we
received the Distinguished Patron of the Arts awards for the second time. We were conferred the Charity Platinum
Award and the Volunteer Partner Award at the Community Chest Awards 2023. We were also recognised as a
Pioneer Partner of Change for coming onboard the Change for Charity initiative.

Upcycling doors from SIT flats into art sculptures
“Project OPENDOOR has given me the
opportunity to learn how to collaborate with
other artists, and I could earn some fees to
support myself,” said Mr Joe Lee, an artist
with ART:DIS.
Driven by our belief in building a more inclusive
society and advocating for sustainability, UOL
embarked on Project OPENDOOR with ART:DIS
to co-create a public art installation, with the
aim to open doors to more opportunities for
Project OPENDOOR was launched to empower artists with
disabilities to live independently in the community.
the artists to realise their aspirations and
earn their livelihoods. Three doors from the
conserved Singapore Improvement Trust
(SIT) flats at our Avenue South Residence project were upcycled and turned into art sculptures by six
artists for installation at the Sky Garden of the completed condominium.
From conceptualisation to painting and installation, the process took more than eight months. Before
the artists began to create the artworks, they were mentored by a multidisciplinary artist to learn about
Contemporary Art installation. During the painting process, UOL volunteers supported the artists, as
some of them had mobility difficulties when handling the doors and art materials. Apart from the UOL
team, our value chain partners for Avenue South Residence – the landscape architect from Henning
Larsen Pte. Ltd. and the main contractor United Tec – lent their efforts during the installation in July 2023.
We share a video here on Project OPENDOOR that captured the entire journey.

The art sculptures (showing six sides of three doors) created for Project OPENDOOR were on display at Avenue South Residence’s
Sky Garden, encouraging visitors to interact with them and enjoy art.

Singapore’s first comprehensive inclusive art prize
In May 2023, we launched our flagship UOL X ART:DIS Art Prize, which is Singapore’s first comprehensive
art prize that recognises all stages of artistic practice by artists with disabilities. The biennial competition
drew over 300 submissions from 17 special education (SPED) schools and ART:DIS. Participants ranged
from six to 76 years old, across a spectrum of disabilities including sensory, intellectual, developmental
and physical.
At the awards ceremony on 4 August 2023 at The Arts House, 28 winners were announced, in the presence
of Ms Low Yen Ling, Minister of State for Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth and Ministry of Trade
and Industry. The ceremony honoured eight award recipients across two main categories – the Open
category recognised young students aged six to 18 from SPED schools, and the Closed category was
artists from ART:DIS aged 19 and above.
Mr Liam Wee Sin, UOL Group Chief Executive, said: “Together with our community partner ART:DIS and
the judging panel, we have witnessed an inspiring showcase of artistic brilliance from an amazing group
of participants. Picasso said that ‘It took me four years to paint like Raphael, but a lifetime to paint like
a child’. A child is a creative genius by nature. Similarly, the Art Prize celebrates the unique perspectives
of artists with disabilities and a sense of honesty that each of the submissions and winning pieces has.”
The winners were selected by a panel of art experts, namely Ms Mae Anderson, Chairman, Art Outreach
and Managing Director, Head of Philanthropy Services, Asia, BNP Paribas Wealth Management;
Ms Dee Chia, Deputy Director of Audience Engagement, National Gallery Singapore; Mr John Tung,
an independent curator and exhibition-maker; and Ms Adeline Kueh, Senior Lecturer, Lasalle College
of the Arts Singapore. Mr Liam was also on the judging panel.
Ms Angela Tan, ART:DIS Executive Director, said: “We hope that winners of the Art Prize will gain greater
public support and equal access to professional development opportunities.”
The winning artworks were on display for public viewing at The Arts House from 5 to 14 August 2023.
The UOL X ART:DIS Art Prize will return in 2025 to continue its purpose as a catalyst for greater
representation, acknowledgement and appreciation for artists with disabilities.

GOVERNANCE

DOING RIGHT: CONDUCTING BUSINESS PROFITABLY AND RESPONSIBLY
ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board oversees the overall governance of risk, strategic direction and accountability of the Group. To pursue
a sustainable long-term growth strategy amidst increasing ESG concerns, the Board recognises the importance
of, and has responsibility of ensuring that the Management designs, implements and monitors an effective
system of risk management and internal controls that incorporate stakeholders’ considerations as part of good
governance. The adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’s risk management and internal control systems are
also reviewed by the Board annually.
The ARMSC assists the Board in carrying out the Board’s responsibilities of overseeing the Group’s risk profile,
providing guidance on key risks, and monitoring the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management
framework and policies, as well as the system of internal controls. The ARMSC reviews, and the Board endorses,
the Group’s risk strategy, appetite and risk policies, which determine the nature and extent of significant risks
that the Group is willing to take to achieve our strategic and business objectives.
At the Management level, the Group Risk Management Committee (GRMC), chaired by the Group Chief
Executive and comprising the Senior Management staff from both the property and hospitality businesses,
reports to the ARMSC on a half-yearly basis or more frequently as needed. The GRMC highlights significant risk
issues, both existing and emerging, for discussion with the ARMSC and the Board, considering the immediate
operating environment and the longer-term business implications. In addition, the GRMC directs and monitors
the implementation and running of enterprise-wide risk management across the Group.
The Group has established an ERM Framework, which aims to increase confidence in the Group’s strategies,
businesses, and operations through assurance that key risks are properly and systematically addressed. For a
comprehensive risk identification and assessment, an integrated top-down and bottom-up risk review process
is in place. Business functions undergo and perform their self-assessment of key risks and mitigating measures,
which are aggregated for reporting. The GRMC examines them, in conjunction with the Group’s top-tier risks,
and deliberates on any potential significant threats or opportunities that may impact the Group’s businesses, at
both the strategic and operational levels. New or emerging concerns highlighted from these forums are addressed
in consultation with business owners, for further assessment and follow-up actions. Where necessary, crossfunctional support and/or external consultants are involved to ensure risk management measures are implemented
efficiently and effectively. This ongoing dialogue with relevant stakeholders facilitates a more robust and relevant
ERM within the Group. The Management sets the appropriate tone at the top and continuously reinforces the
“risk-aware” culture within the Group, with the belief that risk management is every employee’s responsibility.
The Management strives to maintain constant communication and integrate risk management principles in the
day-to-day decision-making and business processes. Business owners and line managers are also accountable
for and own their respective risks. To promote risk awareness and enhance risk management knowledge, the
Management staff in both the property and hospitality businesses actively participate in regular ERM discussions
and training, as well as workshops to acquire and maintain an adequate understanding of ERM concepts,
methodologies and tools.
We will progressively phase in climate-related risks in the short, medium and long term as part of the overall
ERM framework in line with the recommendations of the TCFD.

COMPLIANCE AND FAIR COMPETITION
UOL is steadfast in our continuing efforts to uphold high standards of corporate governance and business conduct,
so as to enhance long-term shareholder value and safeguard the interests of our stakeholders. We comply with
all relevant laws and regulations. In 2023, we did not report any significant fines, significant instances of noncompliance or incur any non-monetary sanctions.
Code of Business Conduct
Our Code of Business Conduct (CBC) sets out expectations of employees in relation to issues such as fraud,
bribery, conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, anti-competitive conduct, violations of human rights,
harassment, health, safety, and the environment. It directs employees to consult their Heads of Departments
or Human Resource representatives in case of queries or issues. All employees are required to review and affirm
their compliance with the CBC annually.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023

Human Rights Statement and Practices
UOL believes in treating employees well, having diversity and inclusivity in our workforce, and implementing
workplace health and safety measures to safeguard them. The Group does not knowingly engage in any activity
that involves child or forced labour or human rights abuses. The Group’s CBC sets the ethical and professional
standards for all employees who are required to obey and comply with all applicable laws and regulations in the
countries where we operate. All employees are required to declare their compliance with the CBC annually and
undergo regular training.
The Group is already subject to the Prevention of Human Trafficking Act 2014 (Singapore Statutes). There is a
whistleblowing policy for employees and other parties to report on infringement of the CBC or any other laws,
regulations, policies, and processes, which would include applicable slavery and human trafficking laws in the
relevant jurisdictions. UOL expects our contractors and suppliers to comply with all relevant laws and regulations,
and these would include applicable labour-related slavery and human trafficking laws in the relevant jurisdictions.
We do not knowingly engage any contractors and suppliers in breach of these laws.
UOL is committed to protecting the principles of human rights, including those pertaining to child labour, forced
labour and human trafficking in its employment on an international level. We also practise fair and inclusive hiring
processes and are guided by the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP) provided by the
Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP), which is established by the Ministry
of Manpower, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress.
In 2023, there were no reported cases of discrimination or violations of human rights.
Whistle-blowing Policy
In relation to the CBC, a whistle-blowing policy is in place to encourage and provide a channel for employees and
external parties dealing with employees to report, in good faith and confidence, concerns about possible fraud,
improprieties in financial reporting, and other matters. This policy contains clear provisions on the protection of
whistle-blowers. Contact details of the Head of the Group Internal Audit are disclosed on the corporate website.
He is responsible for investigating any concerns raised and reporting findings to the ARMSC, independent of
Management. In 2023, to the best of our knowledge and based on all available information, there were no critical
concerns raised.

ANTI-CORRUPTION AND ANTI-BRIBERY
UOL adopts a zero-tolerance stance towards fraud and corruption. All new hires are briefed on the CBC, which
states our firm position against fraud and corruption. The Board, through the ARMSC, has in place processes to
monitor and address any fraud or corruption issues. For contracts with key suppliers and contractors, they are
required to acknowledge that the Group does not tolerate corruption and/or fraud, and it is required of them to
comply with all applicable laws and regulations. In 2023, 100% of employees and UOL Board of Directors were
informed of our CBC and the anti-corruption policies and procedures.
Through our ERM framework, business owners can identify and mitigate high risk areas, including corruption.
Key risks identified are subsequently reported to the ARMSC. In 2023, no significant risk related to corruption
was identified through the risk assessment. Additionally, UOL’s Internal Audit (IA) identifies and investigates
high-risk areas for possible red flags as part of our IA work cycle. Observations from the audit conducted and
recommended improvements help in reducing the overall exposure and minimising the impact arising from
corruption and bribery risk.
Minor Fraud Cases
Based on all available information, we recorded two confirmed minor cases of fraud. We took immediate actions
against these two employees and terminated their employment. Their cases were not related to bribery, corruption,
money laundering or insider trading. Cases were assessed by the Group as insignificant.

APPENDIX B: NOTES FOR SUSTAINABILITY DATA
GENERAL
1.

Buildings
• Mixed Developments: Novena Square and United Square
• Office: Odeon 331
• Retail: KINEX
• Hotels: PARKROYAL on Beach Road, PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, PARKROYAL COLLECTION
Marina Bay, Pan Pacific Singapore and Pan Pacific Orchard.
• Serviced Suites: PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Beach Road, Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Beach Road and
Pan Pacific Serviced Suites Orchard.
Pan Pacific Orchard was included in FY2023, as it started operations in June 2023. PARKROYAL on Kitchener
Road was included until FY2022, as it was divested in FY2023.

2.

Development projects: Refers to construction and redevelopment activities that took place in Singapore,
including joint ventures with SingLand. This includes AMO Residence, Avenue South Residence, Clavon,
The Watergardens at Canberra, Pinetree Hill, Watten House, Pan Pacific Orchard, Faber House site and
Odeon 333.

3.

Corporate Office: Refers to electricity consumption at UOL’s corporate office. Water data is unavailable, as
water is not separately metered. Our corporate office sits in United Square and forms a subset of the building
energy and water figures reported.

ENVIRONMENT
4.

Coverage within a building: Data from tenants is excluded for all properties since 2019.

5.

District Cooling: The BCA Energy Benchmarking Report excludes properties with district cooling, which
can form a significant part of energy consumption. Pan Pacific Singapore and PARKROYAL COLLECTION
Marina Bay use district cooling technology.

6.

GFA and GFA occupied:
• We report our energy, GHG emissions, water, and waste intensity figures by GFA and GFA occupied.
• We adopt BCA’s definition of GFA. All covered floor areas of a building, except otherwise exempted,
uncovered areas for commercial uses, are deemed the GFA of the building. Generally, car parks are
excluded from GFA computation.
• In our Commercial Properties, GFA computation includes common areas as well as tenant areas, due to
the building’s central air conditioning systems.
• For Hotels and Serviced Suites, the GFA computation methodology was updated in 2020 to exclude tenant
area as tenant area is small and not all properties have tenants. 2019 data for Hotels and Serviced Suites
has been restated to exclude tenant areas from GFA.
• GFA occupied is calculated by occupancy rate (simple average of monthly occupancy rates) multiplied by GFA.

7.

Guest night: We adopt the definition of guest night as follows:
• Guest night includes i) guests/staff staying overnight, ii) day/banquet guests and iii) non-resident restaurant
guests, as illustrated in the equation below:
Guest night = Overnight guests/staff + (Day/banquet guests ÷ 3) + (Non-resident restaurant guests ÷ 4)
i) Guests/staff staying overnight: The number of guests staying overnight equals the number of people staying
over each night (including complimentary stays and staff that live onsite), added up over the year.
Example: Two people sharing a room for three nights is equal to six guest nights (2 x 3)

54

UOL GROUP LIMITED

ii) Day guests: Day guests represent the number of non-resident day guests (for example, the number of
people turning up to use onsite facilities such as a spa, golf course, MICE, or business centre, but do
not stay overnight) added up over the year.
Day guests would also include delegates attending day conferences and/or functions. Please note that
‘Day guests’ does not include restaurant covers.
Example: Over the year, a hotel’s fitness centre received an additional 3,750 non-resident users. This
would be equivalent to 1,250 guest nights (3,750 ÷ 3).
iii) Non-resident restaurant guests: Non-resident restaurant guests represent the number of non-resident
day guests (for example, the number of people turning up to dine at F&B outlets/restaurants, but do
not stay overnight) added up over the benchmarking period (typically 365 days).
Example: Over the year, a hotel’s restaurants/F&B outlets received an additional 2,000 non-resident
restaurant users. This would be equivalent to 500 guest nights (2,000 ÷ 4).
8.

Building and development site details including property type, area, and occupancy rates are available in
UOL Annual Report 2023’s Property Summary, pages 86 to 93.

9.

Emission factors for diesel and piped gas reference the “Emission Factors from Cross-Sector Tools” worksheet
obtained from the GHG Protocol. Emission factors for electricity generation are sourced from the Energy
Market Authority (EMA) (January 2023 to December 2023 data will reference EMA 2022 emission factor of
0.4168 kg CO2/kWh).
The source of conversion factor from diesel in litres to kWh and piped gas in m3 to kWh, and emission factors
for the calculation of Scope 3 GHG emissions, references the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (DEFRA), a third-party database recognised by the GHG Protocol.

10. Waste data for commercial properties include all users of the buildings.
11.

Waste data for hospitality properties include guests, but excludes retail and F&B tenants, except for PARKROYAL
on Beach Road, where waste data includes disposal from PARKROYAL Serviced Suites Singapore and tenants
at The Plaza, as these properties share the same disposal receptacle.

12. The waste intensity formula excludes waste recycled. Waste intensity for hospitality is derived from the total
number of guest nights for simplicity.

HEALTH AND SAFETY
13. Workplace health and safety data include development projects and hospitality properties.
• Coverage for development projects: Workplace accidents involving main contractors and sub-contractors.
• Coverage for hospitality properties: Workplace accidents involving all employees and contractors at hotels
and service suites.
14. A recordable work-related injury is defined as a work-related injury or ill health that results in any of the
following: death, days away from work, restricted work or transfer to another job, medical treatment beyond
first aid, or loss of consciousness; or significant injury or ill health diagnosed by a physician or other licensed
healthcare professional, even if it does not result in death, days away from work, restricted work or job
transfer, medical treatment beyond first aid, or loss of consciousness.
• Recordable work-related injury rate = (Number of recordable work-related injuries (excluding fatalities)
/ Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000
• High-consequence work-related injury is defined as a work-related injury that results in a fatality or in
an injury from which the worker cannot, does not, or is not expected to recover fully to pre-injury health
status within six months.
• High-consequence work-related injury rate = (Number of high-consequence work-related injuries
(excluding fatalities) / Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023

55

15. The number of man-hours worked in safety data reported:
• Development projects: The number of man-hours includes main contractors’ and sub-contractors’ hours.
• Hospitality properties: The number of man-hours includes employees’ and contractors’ hours.
16. Fatalities as a result of work must also be reported to MOM. Data collection for FY2021 onwards was updated
in line with the changes to MOM’s Work Injury Compensation Act that came into effect in September 2020,
which includes reporting all instances of medical leave or light duties issued for a work accident.
17.

Lost days are calculated based on calendar days at UOL and scheduled workdays at PPHG. Lost day rate =
(Number of lost days) / (Number of hours worked) x 1,000,000.

PEOPLE
18. While UOL Management Services (UMS) is a wholly-owned subsidiary, the working relationship is such
that UMS is considered to be a contractor supplying facility management services to UOL. As such, figures
reported for our property business exclude UMS as employees and instead report figures relating to UMS
under contractors, where applicable.
19. Scheduled workdays are calculated by 5 days x 52 weeks minus actual public holidays, actual annual leave,
and actual parental leave.
20. A significant portion of the property development business is performed by our contractors during construction.
Facilities management services are provided by UMS.
21. Average training hours per employee = Total training hours for the year/Number of employees as of 31
December of the reporting year.
22. The definition of Senior Management is ‘Assistant General Manager and above’ for the property business,
whereas, for the hospitality business, it is ‘Vice President and above, Executive Committee Member and
Head of Department’.
23. The definition of Locals is Singapore Residents.
24. Non-voluntary turnovers refer to employees who have retired, been dismissed, terminated from their current
position, and resigned due to non-confirmation in employment or to avoid dismissal/termination. Voluntary
turnovers refer to employees who resign prior to reaching retirement age or during post-retirement contract.

COMMUNITY
25. We track our community contributions internally and only report some key contributions.

COMPLIANCE
26. The scope of the number of significant fines or non-monetary sanctions includes:
• Non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
• Incidents of non-compliance concerning the health and safety impacts of products and services.
• Written statement by regulatory or similar official body addressed to the organisation that identifies
breaches of customer privacy and where the regulatory or similar official body has made a finding of
non-compliance against the organisation.
• Non-compliance with laws and regulations in the social and economic areas.
“Significant fines” and “non-monetary sanctions” are defined as deemed to have significant reputational
impact by the SSC.

INDEPENDENT LIMITED ASSURANCE REPORT
IN CONNECTION WITH UOL GROUP LIMITED (“UOL” or “GROUP”) SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023 FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2023

We have performed a limited assurance engagement on UOL Group Limited (“UOL” or “Group”)’s Sustainability
Report for the year ended 31 December 2023 (“Sustainability Report 2023”) and selected Global Reporting Initiative
(“GRI”) Universal Standards 2021 disclosures (“Disclosures”) as identified below (collectively, the “Sustainability
Information”).
Our assurance engagement does not extend to information in respect of earlier periods included in or linked
to from the Sustainability Report 2023 or from UOL’s Annual Report 2023, including any images, audio files or
embedded videos.

LIMITED ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
Based on the procedures we have performed as described under the “Summary of the work we performed as
the basis of our assurance conclusion” and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to our attention
that causes us to believe that
(a) the Sustainability Report 2023 has not described, in all material respects, the sustainability practices on a

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2023

65

We do not express an assurance conclusion on information in respect of earlier periods included in or linked
to from the Sustainability Report 2023 or from the Annual Report 2023, including any images, audio files or
embedded videos.

UOL’S RESPONSIBILITY
Management of UOL is responsible for:
• Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Sustainability Information;
• Preparing the Sustainability Report 2023 and selected GRI Disclosures in accordance with the Rule 711B of the
SGX Listing Manual and Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Universal Standards 2021 respectively (collectively
known as “Reporting Criteria”); and
• Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the
Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

UNDERSTANDING HOW UOL HAS PREPARED THE SUSTAINABILITY INFORMATION
The absence of a commonly used generally accepted reporting framework or a significant body of established
practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure sustainability information allows for different, but acceptable,
measurement techniques that can affect comparability between entities and over time.
Consequently, the Sustainability Information needs to be read and understood together with the Reporting Criteria
and the basis of preparation set out in the Introduction section under “About This Report” of the Sustainability
Report 2023, which UOL has used to prepare the Sustainability Information.

OUR RESPONSIBILITIES
We are responsible for:
• Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Sustainability
Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;
• Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have
obtained; and
• Reporting our conclusion to the Board of Directors and management of UOL.
As we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Sustainability Information as prepared by
management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Sustainability Information as doing
so may compromise our independence.

PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS APPLIED
We performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with Singapore Standard on Assurance Engagements
3000 (Revised) – Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information
(“Standard”).

PRACTITIONER’S INDEPENDENCE AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT
We have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the Accounting and Corporate
Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting
Entities (“ACRA Code”) which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional
competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour.
The firm applies Singapore Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement
and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical
requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.

SUMMARY OF THE WORK WE PERFORMED AS THE BASIS OF OUR ASSURANCE CONCLUSION
We are required to plan and perform our work to address the areas where we have identified that a material
misstatement of the Sustainability Information is likely to arise. The procedures we performed were based on
our professional judgement. In carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Sustainability Information,
our procedures included the following:
• Evaluated the suitability in the circumstances of UOL’s use of the Reporting Criteria, as the basis for preparing
the Sustainability Information;
• Through inquiries, obtained an understanding of UOL’s control environment, processes and information
systems relevant to the preparation of the Sustainability Information, but we did not evaluate the design of
particular control activities, did not obtain evidence about their implementation and did not test their operating
effectiveness;
• Evaluated whether UOL’s methods for developing estimates are appropriate and had been consistently applied,
but our procedures did not include testing the data on which the estimates were based and we did not separately
develop our own estimates against which to evaluate UOL’s estimates;
• Sample tested a number of items to or from supporting records, as appropriate;
• Performed analytical procedures by comparing the expected targets to actual emissions or consumption, and
by comparing current period to prior period, and made inquiries of management to obtain explanations for
any significant differences we identified; and
• Considered the presentation and disclosure of the Sustainability Information.
The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in
extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited
assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable
assurance engagement been performed.

PURPOSE AND RESTRICTION ON DISTRIBUTION AND USE
This report is made solely to the Board of Directors and management of UOL Group Limited in accordance with
our engagement letter dated 07 November 2023 for the purpose of providing a limited assurance conclusion on
the Sustainability Information. As a result, the report may not be suitable for another purpose.
We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any person other than the Board of
Directors and management of UOL Group Limited, or for any purpose other than that for which it was prepared.
